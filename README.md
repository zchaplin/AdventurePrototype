A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: I had StartRoom and 4 other rooms called BaseRoom PianoRoom HornRoom StringsRoom 
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro and Outro
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: I added a function to play audio
    - Enhancement 2: I added a function to make a lil guy jump to the music

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: 4 different rooms with instruments in them
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: all the doors and playable instruments
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: basically every thing has one of these
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: All the doors and instruments
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Edgar going up and down also the bottle at the begenning bobbing

Asset sources:
- All the audio assests where created and composed by me in a music production app called band lab
- Edgar was made using the website sketchpad

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
